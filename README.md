# Sorting Algorithms

@author Anastasiia Ryzhkova
@version Java 17

# Description
The project contains various sorting algorithms implementation in order to get benchmark data.

# To Run
Application is compiled from console in bin directory:
jar -cf Algorithms.jar *
Application is run from console at .jar file directory:
java -cp .:./Algorithms.jar ie.atu.sw.AlgorithmRunner
Then navigate through console options (1 and 2) to configure desired lexicon and then analyse the text with the lexicon provided in step 1. Option 3 can be used to exit the application. 

# Features

```
Java code to calculate benchmark is placed in AlgorithmRunner class and includes:
Running the code for required sizes of input 100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1250, 2500, 3750, 5000, 6250, 7500, 8750, 10000
Recording of each algorithm run time in nanoseconds with conversion to milliseconds 

```
